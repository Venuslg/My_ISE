#SDLC of a Real-World System
Comparative Analysis of a Digital Wallet Application
This repository contains the academic project report titled “Comparing Different Ways to Build a Digital Wallet Application”.
The project presents a comparative study of Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) models applied to a real-world fintech system.
The study focuses on requirement analysis, risk management, scalability, security, regulatory compliance, and development model selection for high-risk financial software systems.

#Repository Overview
This repository includes the complete project documentation submitted as part of the B.Tech – Information Science and Engineering curriculum.

#Repository Structure
1. Initial Report
Contains the initial draft of the SDLC analysis prepared during the early phase of the project.
This version reflects the preliminary study before detailed refinement of requirements, risk analysis, and SDLC model comparison.

2. Final Report
Contains the revised and finalized version of the project after incorporating improvements in:
•	Functional and non-functional requirement analysis
•	SDLC model comparison
•	Risk evaluation
•	Requirement validation planning
•	Overall documentation quality
This version is intended for final evaluation and submission.

Files Included
•	Assignment1_nnm24is006.docx – Final project report (Word)


#Branching Strategy
The main branch contains the stable and submission-ready version of the project report.
A separate branch was created to work on updates, refinements, and improvements to the documentation (e.g., SDLC comparison, requirements refinement, formatting corrections).
After completing revisions and performing self-review:
•	Changes were validated
•	Conflicts were resolved
•	The updated content was merged back into the main branch
This approach demonstrates fundamental version control practices such as:
•	Branch creation
•	Parallel development
•	Controlled merging
•	Document versioning
Even though this is a documentation-based academic project (without source code), proper branching ensures structured development and traceability of changes.
